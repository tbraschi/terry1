Perv,

Are you saying that in an Icarus (OSGI) context you need
"$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX" ?  I wouldn't think so and I would think that fixing
the framework to with Icarus would also work with PPSM?

Owen,

Can we still use yum if we make the package Requires a config file/package
that puppet can provide?  If we have to go the custom route, is there even =
a
point in using rpm ?  How about rpm2cpio and bypassing the rpmdb?  I though=
t
the plan was to use .zip  anyway=8A

Mike

Subject: Investigating Helix and PPSM "on the cheap"

Greetings,

Per Moied's request, I've been looking into whether there is a solution for
managing Helix and Sparta apps in PPSM with minimal changes to the framewor=
k
and applications; i.e. sticking with the legacy RPM-based deploy mechanism
we use in stages today.  I've started my investigation with Helix, speaking
with Perv and Steffen and looking at the Helix framework code, and here are
the results so far:

- Assume we use the YUM provider. Then the major problem I've found with
installing a legacy Helix RPM is the switch of the prefix directory from
/x/web/<STAGE> to /x/web/LIVE.
- It is, unfortunately, not just LayoutToCdb that uses the prefix to
determine configuration (this is unfortunate because we've already fixed
LayoutToCdb to work in a PPSM-managed situation). The postinstallation
scripts in the Helix application also use  the prefix. In particular,
postinstall.sh sets an environment variable STAGE based on
$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX, and passes this variable as a command line option to
several subsidiary deploy tools in the framework. This value also ends up i=
n
a config file called  deploy-info.properties which several other tools and
applications use.
- Changing postinstall.sh is a change to the helix framework. The minimal
impact I see therefore in following this route is 1) making the change to
all currently used versions of the framework, while ensuring the deploy
scripts still work correctly in  legacy deploys, and 2) getting all Helix
app owners to upgrade their framework.
- Perv and Steffen also believe that there will be additional places across
Helix application code that will attempt to use the installation path to
determine what environment the application is in. However, the extent of
this is currently unknown.
- Perv maintains that a framework change to Helix at this point in the game=
,
especially one that reaches across multiple framework versions, is
infeasible both for Java Infrastructure and for the app owners.

Assuming Perv is right and this path is infeasible, then we must break the
assumption that the YUM provider is used to install packages, and figure ou=
t
how to get Puppet to do purely legacy installations, installing with a
custom RPMDB and prefix /x/web/<STAGE>.  This presents significant
challenges on the Puppet side:

- Either a custom provider must be built for the RPM installation, or we
must make careful use of exec resources to install packages and updates.
- An additional Puppet class must be developed to initialize the RPM
database and install standard legacy packages (provider & logs at a
minimum).

Both approaches involve a significantly reduced value proposition,
especially in the second approach where Puppet's management will largely be
reduced to simply trying to reproduce what Yoda already does. Further, the
second approach, if adopted, begs  the question of whether C++/Gimp package
conversion still needs to go forward, since that legacy solution could
manage legacy C++ packages as well.

If our goal for this next phase is just to get Puppet managing at all costs=
,
then the second approach could be explored further. But Tucker & I have lon=
g
maintained that that approach is a lateral step, and have argued against
this approach from the inception  of the program.

As-yet-unanswered questions:
- If we switch back to RPMs for Java applications, we need to determine
whether there is any work in getting them to be included in labels as RPMs
instead of Maven artifacts. Would we need  any Fusion changes?
- How would topo work in this case? Can we get away with just topo-yaml? Or
do we need to install a legacy topo package as well?
- How would config overrides work in this case? (Kenneth had a solution
proposed for this on the C++ side; I need to see where he's at with that.)
- How does database configuration work? To my surprise my helixtestserv
installation used DEVPLAT as the database, not STAGE2FOO or LIVE. I'm not
sure how that happened.
